I have tried to run the ESLint, and it seems have some difficulties with windows.
So during the team meeting, we have asked professor about this and he told us to not worry about it.

I have ran the format document, and it shows nothing to fix. The code was implemented correctly, and it seems good on it.
I also used JavaDoc auto generator on App.js to wrtie some descriptions about the app.
