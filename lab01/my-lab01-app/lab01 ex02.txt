   C) 112 with B, and I'm currently taking CS 212
2. A) For JS, I used it during my internship last summer. I'm not super good at it, but I used it 	before. I was part of frontend team during my internship. And for the database, I believe I'm just at the intermediate level.
   B) Never used Slack and Trello before, but I have used git and GitHub before. For GitHub, I used it to upload my personal project and school project. And I used git during Hackathon. 
   C) Peets order
     - Everyone have experienced a situation that you really need a cup of coffee but you are running out of time and can't wait for a long line at Peet's. I want to make an app that provides remote ordering system for students and faculty members, and you can save your punch card on this application.
