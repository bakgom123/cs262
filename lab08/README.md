SQL queries that return the information from the Monopoly database

Answers to the lab questions:
8.2 (C) What does that P1.ID < P2.ID clause do in the last example query?
- Even though their name is the same, it belongs to different player.

8.2 (D) The query that joined the Player table to itself seems rather contrived. Can you think of a realistic situation in which youâ€™d want to join a table to itself?
- This could be useful if you need to compare rows or with the query data with heirarchy. For example, when creating heirarchy of king to low class people of the UK.
